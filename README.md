### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Chris, and I'm a Network Engineer.  I enjoy coding where it can help.

I started with the Cisco DevNet path, but I have since moved to more general Python, a lot of text parsing, and Terraform.

At home, I have a Home Assistant server, and I want to help the community there.

I'm most excited about learning more about machine learning.
